# Virtual-Doorbell
Virtual doorbell for factory usage.

## Overview
A Virtual Doorbell system provides a safe, reliable way for visitors to alert floor personnel to a presence at an entrance. This proposed solution would include a **digital access console** at the entryway, and a **visual notification display** inside the shop to alert staff to a visitor's presence.

## Problem
Currently floor personnel deal with a **loud environment** that necessitatese the use of noise-reducing headphones or other sensory bockers that avoid harm. When visitors arrive at the shop, they are forced to knock on the door and hope someone is aware enough to allow entry. Therefore, a solution is needed that provides **visual notification** to the specified floor personnell based on **user input at the entry** to gain access.

## Solution
Using a touch display (HMI or Rasp. Pi screen), a 'Ring' button UI + status indicator, logic processor, and visual alert display, we can easily implement a scalable system for usage on the floor.
